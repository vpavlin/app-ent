# Providers

This chapter includes links to documentation on how to use and configure the
providers that are supported by Atomic App. The linked documentation
will give you a short overview of all available providers and how
to use them.

**NOTE**: Not all Atomic Apps must support each provider. One Atomic App may
only include deployment information for OpenShift while another supports
OpenShift and Kubernetes.

## List of providers
Atomic App includes four providers:

  * Docker
  * Kubernetes
  * OpenShift 3
  * Marathon (Mesos)

You can run any of the providers via the Atomic App CLI.

Additionally, for the openshift provider there is some native support
within OpenShift that allows for Atomic Apps to be executed with
OpenShift CLI tools.

More documentation for each of the providers can be found in the links
below:

   * [Docker](./providers/docker/overview.md)
   * [Kubernetes](./providers/kubernetes/overview.md)
   * [OpenShift](./providers/openshift/overview.md)
   * [Marathon (Mesos)](./providers/marathon/overview.md)
