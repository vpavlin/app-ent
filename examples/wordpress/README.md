# Container App of Wordpress
This repository serves as part of example for [Container App Spec](https://github.com/aweiteka/containerapp-spec). It packages metadata for Wordpress Docker container. It can be run by [reference python implementation](https://github.com/vpavlin/atomicapp-run). It has a runtime dependency on [MariaDB app](https://github.com/vpavlin/atomicapp-mariadb).

Sources for the underlying image that is actually run can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/vpavlin/docker-tools/tree/master/run-container/wordpress).
