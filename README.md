# Atomic App

Atomic App is a reference implementation of the [Nulecule Specification](http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/nulecule/). It can be used to bootstrap container applications and to install and run them. Atomic App is designed to be run in a container context. Examples using this tool may be found in the [Nulecule examples directory](https://github.com/projectatomic/nulecule/tree/master/examples).

## Getting Started

Atomic App is packaged as a container. End-users typically do not install the software from source. Instead use the atomicapp container as the `FROM` line in a Dockerfile and package your application on top. For example:

```
FROM projectatomic/atomicapp:0.4.2

MAINTAINER Your Name <you@example.com>

ADD /Nulecule /Dockerfile README.md /application-entity/
ADD /artifacts /application-entity/artifacts
```

For more information see the [Atomic App getting started guide](http://www.projectatomic.io/docs/atomicapp/).

## Developers

See CONTRIBUTING.md for development.

## Providers

Providers represent various deployment targets. They can be added by placing a file called `provider_name.py` in `providers/`. This file needs to implement the interface explained in (providers/README.md). For a detailed description of all providers available see the [Provider description](docs/providers.md).

## Dependencies

Please see [REQUIREMENTS](https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp/blob/master/docs/requirements.md) for current Atomic App dependencies.
