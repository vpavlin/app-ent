# Atomic App

![](docs/images/logo.png "Project Atomic")

Atomic App is a reference implementation of the [Nulecule](docs/spec/README.md) specification. Packaged Atomic App containers are "Nuleculized" and each component of the package is a "Nulecule".

Atomic App is used to bootstrap packaged container environments and run them on multiple container orchestrators. It is designed from the ground-up to be portable and provider pluggable.

  - __A "packaged installer" for all container-based environments and applications.__ Replace all those bash and Ansible scripts with one container-based deployment tool.

  - __Target multiple providers:__ Specify the provider you want the Atomic App to run on. It supports Kubernetes, OpenShift, Mesos+Marathon and Docker.

  - __Inherit already packaged containers:__ Create composite applications by referencing other Nulecule-compliant applications. For example, plugging in an alternative well-orchestrated database in another referenced container image.

  - __Fetch and run entire environments:__ Use `atomicapp fetch` and `atomicapp run` to run pre-packaged Nuleculized containers.

## Installing Atomic App
From Linux:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp && cd atomicapp
sudo make install
```

_or_ 

Download a pre-signed .tar.gz from [download.projectatomic.io](https://download.projectatomic.io) / [GitHub](https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp/releases):
```sh
export RELEASE=0.6.4
wget https://github.com/projectatomic/atomicapp/releases/download/$RELEASE/atomicapp-$RELEASE.tar.gz

## Getting started

Atomic App can be used either natively on your OS __or__ ran via the [atomic](https://github.com/projectatomic/atomic) command on [Fedora or CentOS Atomic hosts](https://www.projectatomic.io/download/).

__Detailed instructions on [getting started](docs/start_guide.md) are available.__ Alternatively, use the [quick start guide](docs/quick_start.md) to get a Nuleculized application running immediately.

An extended guide on the `Nulecule` file format is [also available](docs/nulecule.md).

## Real-world examples
Atomic App can be used to launch a cluster of containers (application servers, databases, etc.).

For a list of already packaged examples, visit the [nulecule-library](https://github.com/projectatomic/nulecule-library) repo.

## Providers

We currently support:

  - Docker
  - Kubernetes
  - OpenShift 3
  - Marathon (Mesos)

Providers represent various deployment targets. They can be added by placing the artifact within the respective in `artifacts/` folder. For example, placing `deploy_pod.yml` within `artifacts/kubernetes/`. 

For a detailed description of all providers available see [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md).
